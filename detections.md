# Detections

This section highlights detection engineering work I’ve done — focusing on **high-confidence detections** built for real-world threats.

## 🛡️ Banking Trojan – ERMAC v3.0
- Built detections around **C2 backend & panel traffic**.
- Identified **exfiltration paths, API routes, and authentication artifacts** used by the malware.
- Deployed detection logic into SIEM with **custom rules and automation workflows**.

## 🔎 Persistence & Privilege Escalation Techniques
- Tuned detections for **Windows persistence mechanisms** (registry, scheduled tasks, WMI).
- Monitored for **abuse of LSASS, token manipulation, and UAC bypasses**.

## 🌐 Cloud Security Detections
- Created **Azure Sentinel rules** for suspicious API calls, anomalous sign-ins, and data exfil attempts.
- Automated **IOC enrichment** via Threat Intel + SOAR.
